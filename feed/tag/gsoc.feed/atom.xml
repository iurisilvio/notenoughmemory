I just tried to build, checked the error message &lt;cite&gt;&amp;quot;some lib not found&amp;quot;&lt;/cite&gt;, installed that lib, tried to build again and again... dozen of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, of course I researched about how to build it in a better way. It is really easy using Ubuntu. First of all, just clone Scilab repository with git. I used YaSp branch, but it works to master too. After checkout, build all dependencies (the trick part I didn't know):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ apt-get build-dep scilab
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scilab directory, just configure and make project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ./configure
$ make
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post looks really simple, but it is my first post during GSoC and solved a big issue to me (build dependencies).&lt;/p&gt;
