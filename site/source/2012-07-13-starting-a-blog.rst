Starting a blog

It is my first post on this blog. Posts older than this one are just some backup from my previous failed attempts to maintain a blog.

I am using the awesome `Pelican <https://github.com/ametaireau/pelican>`_ to create my static pages and `Github Pages <http://pages.github.com>`_ to serve my blog, because I want a Python based static files generator and I want to learn about `reStructuredText <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_. For now, it has just default things, but I will improve it soon.
